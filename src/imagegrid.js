      <h2>BUT WHAT DO I DO IN MY SPARE TIME?</h2>
      <p>Ignoring the seriousness of what I wrote above, the real question is what does Naveen Bandarage like to do outside of coding? Well my dear reader that question will be answered here. My life does not revolve around coding and I have a multitude of things I like to do when I am afk.</p>
      <p>Photography is one of those things. I recently got into it and now I am hooked. I like digital photography and film photography equally but I appreciate the different skills needed for them. I use a Canon EOS m50 for my digital photos and for film I use a <a href="https://camerapedia.fandom.com/wiki/Olympus_OM-101_/_OM-88" target = "_blank">Olympus OM-101</a>. However I have been playing around with a Kodak disposable camera.</p>
      <p>I love anime and manga as well. You can call me a huge shonen weeb because that is what I literally am. The series as of time of writing that I'm currently invested in are My Hero Academia, Haikyu, One piece, Demon Slayer, Dr. Stone, Fire Force, Spy X family, Undead Unlock, and One Punch Man. However there are so many more feel free to hit me up if you need a series recommendation. </p> 
      <p>I love to read. At the moment I have read <b>13</b> books so far this year. At the moment I am reading <i>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</i> by Yuval Noah Harari. (Note that the book I currently reading and the my book tally for the year will be updated regularly.) </p>
      <p>I need sound around me to stay sane and that comes in the form of music. Not trying to flex but I listened to 109,910 minutes of music in 2019. I love Rap and Hip Hop primarily but I can appreciate all types of music.</p>
